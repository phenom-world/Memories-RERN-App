# Memories App

### <h2 align="center"> ðŸ’«ðŸ’«ðŸ’« &nbsp; [Live Demo](https://memories-app-redis.netlify.app) ðŸ’«ðŸ’«ðŸ’« </h2>

Full Stack "R"ERN Application - from start to finish.

The App is called "Memories" and it is a simple social media app that allows users to post interesting events that happened in their lives. with real app features like user authentication and social login using Google accounts and **REDIS database**.

- Redis is an open-source (BSD-licensed), high-performance key value database and in-memory data structure store used as a database, cache, and message broker. Redis has excellent read-write performance, fast IO read-write speed from memory, and supports read-write frequencies of more than 100k + per second.

Here's a short video that explains the project and how it uses Redis:

## How it works

#### User

```
const userSchema = new Schema(
  User,
  {
    name: {
      type: "string",
    },
    email: {
      type: "string",
    },
    password: {
      type: "string",
    },
  },
  {
    dataStructure: "JSON",
  }
);
```

#### Posts

```
const postSchema = new Schema(
  Post,
  {
    title: { type: "text" },
    message: { type: "text" },
    name: { type: "string" },
    creator: { type: "string" },
    tags: { type: "text" },
    selectedFile: { type: "string" },
    likes: { type: "string[]" },
    comments: { type: "string[]" },
    createdAt: { type: "date", sortable: true },
  },
  {
    dataStructure: "JSON",
  }
);
```

For simplicity, a unique key index with an hash value is created when a user or post is created and creates a new hashed index for subsequently added new repositories. This index key is unique for each repository, User and Post data are then stored in the redis database

> The created unique index keys allows you to perform search on each of the repository

### How the data is stored:

- The user and post data are stored in various keys and various data types.

* For each of user, key like: `User:{userId}` is generated and data is stored like:

  - email: like johndoe@gmail.com
  - password: Encrypted password
  - name: Wakeel Kehinde

* For each of the post, key like: `Post:{postId}` is generated and data is stored like:
  - title: "My memory"
  - message: "Blissful memory"
  - name: "Wakeel Kehinde"
  - creator:"01GBMJVW68YR91FA94Y32NB6FZ" (an entityId of a user)
  - tags: "New, Honey, Moon"
  - selectedFile:"react-string"
  - likes:[ "01GBMJVW68YR91FA94Y32NB6FZ"] (an array of entityId of a user)
  - comments:["wow", "interesting"]
  - createdAt: 1661720826.775 (date stored in milliseconds)

### How the data is accessed:

- Total posts created:


### Performance Benchmarks

<img src="https://github.com/phenom-world/Memories-RERN-App/blob/main/docs/response1.png" width="50%" height="auto">

- The first frame represents the response from the endpoint with MONGODB database
- The second frame represents the response from the endpoint with REDIS database which implies about 3x faster response

## How to run it locally?

- Fork this repo and run the `git clone <forked repo>` command from your terminal/bash
- Make a copy of the `.env.example` file by running the command:

```
$ cp  .env.example .env
```

- Insert the correct values for the environmental variables

- Run the following command to start the application

```
$ npm install concurrently
$ npm install-all
$ npm run dev (to run both React client and Node server side development)
```

> To start Redis Stack developer container using the redis-stack image, run the following command in your terminal:

```
$ docker run -d --name redis-stack -p 6379:6379 -p 8001:8001 redis/redis-stack:latest
```

> For Google client Id you have to visit [Google developers console](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/dashboard?pli=1) from here generate your respective client Id Ensure the first two lines of the env file contains the REACT_APP_GOOGLE_API_TOKEN and REACT_APP_BASE_URL

> REDIS_HOST = `redis://localhost:6379`

- Backend server will be running on http://localhost:3005
- Frontend server will be running on http://localhost:3000

### Prerequisites

- Node - v16.16.0
- NPM - v8.11.0
- Docker - v20.10.16

### Local installation

- Run the command below in your rooot directory:

```
$ npm install concurrently
$ npm install-all
```

- Note: This installs all dependencies for the client and the server simultaneously

## Deployment

To make deploys work, you need to create free account on [Redis Cloud](https://redis.info/try-free-dev-to)
